To run any workflow, configure the .secrets file:
    1) Fill the file .secrets using the example from .secrets.example
    2) Export this file to base64: base64 -i .secrets
    3) add a variable ENCODED_SECRETS in github secrets with the value of the previous step

Deploy workflow:
It runs on every commit.
If it is the first run, use the following outputs to configure the deploy of the backend image:
    echo "ECR Repository URL: $ECR_REPOSITORY_URL"
    echo "RDS Endpoint: $RDS_ENDPOINT"

App runner workflow:
After running the deploy workflow and deploying the backed, run the app runner workflow manually in github:
1) Go to your GitHub repo → Click on “Actions”. On the left sidebar, locate “app-runner.yml”.
2) Click “Run workflow” (usually a dropdown button) and confirm.

Destroy workflow:
Same steps from above, it also needs to be triggered manually in github:
1) Go to your GitHub repo → Click on “Actions”. On the left sidebar, locate “destroy.yml”.
2) Click “Run workflow” (usually a dropdown button) and confirm.
